# Challenge-1

# First Challenge #

# The project consists of a website with 4 pages:
- 1: Homepage
- 2: Contact us (registration)
- 3: Error page
- 4: Success page (Returns the data entered at the time of registration)

# Only two buttons go to the registration page, the "Contact-us" button and the "Continue" button.

# If the user enters their email in the email field on the home page, they will be redirected to the registration page with the email automatically entered in the registration form.

# All form fields are validated, the user is instructed to enter the data correctly.

# If the user successfully registers, they will be redirected to the Success page and will see their personal data. 
# At the end there is a "Logout" button that will delete the user's data from LocalStorage.
# And it will return to the Homepage.

# The Project is not responsive, so to consume the page use the web screen size: 1440x500. #
